# Netflix Data Analysis Project

This project was developed as part of a Microcredencial in Python Programming for Data Analysis provided by the University of Aveiro.

## 📊 Objective

To analyze and explore a dataset of Netflix titles (movies and TV shows) using Python and the pandas library. The goal was to practice data manipulation, cleaning, and visualization techniques on real-world data.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset includes titles available on Netflix, with attributes like:
- Title
- Type (Movie or TV Show)
- Description
- Release Year
- Age Certification
- Runtime
- IMDb Score and Votes

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📌 Key Tasks Completed

- Data loading, exploration, and summary statistics
- Handling missing data and creating new features (e.g., 'decade')
- Grouped analysis by content type and age rating
- Filtering top-rated content (IMDb score > 8.0 and >10,000 votes)
- Data visualization (bar chart, scatter plot, histogram)
- Exporting results to CSV and Excel formats

## 🎯 Bonus Challenge

We also tackled a machine learning challenge by:
- Creating a `high_rating` classification target
- Training a Logistic Regression model
- Evaluating it with accuracy, precision, and recall

## 📂 Files

- `Netflix_Analysis.ipynb` – Main notebook with all analysis and visualizations
- `cleaned_data.csv` – Exported dataset (optional)
- `cleaned_data.xlsx` – Exported dataset (optional)
